# fa21-proj2-starter

Project link: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa21/projects/proj2/

The idea of this project is to learn more about RISC-V assembly language and how we can implement some matrix operations. Due to the low-level nature of assembly, the runtime of these implementations are very efficient, but unrefined. In this project, we implemented basic matrix operations as well as a classify function, which is very useful in machine learning classification functions. However, the ultimate goal of the project is to practice assembly language coding. 

Note: due to 61c honor code, the code will be deleted from the repository.
